0,Dog food labels: transparency or confusion?,Learning to read labels correctly,"Is your four-legged friend hungry? Then it should surely be a wholesome, tasty and above all healthy meal. A food that doesn't entice you with advertising promises and ultimately contains none of the supposed benefits. In other words, a meal that contains natural ingredients, is easily digestible, does not cause any problems and is affordable. However, finding the right food for your four-legged friend can be more difficult than you think.

A healthy, species-appropriate dog meal is more than just the price, its declaration, analysis, composition and theoretical supply by numbers. A healthy dog diet depends on many different and important criteria that need to be taken into account when choosing the right food for your four-legged friend. Can you rely on the recommendations of the breeder, the dog trainer or your dog owner friends? It's best not to listen to too many opinions - because that can be confusing. Look at the label instead. Or not?

Here we have reached a point where you should learn to read labels. If you can do this, the decision in favour of or against a dog food will be made quite quickly. This is because you can make a rough selection between good and not-so-good dog food from the label without even having opened the food. This is because many facts about the contents are hidden between the lines."
1,Dog food labels: transparency or confusion?,The 4% rule: legal customer deception,"How about ""Fresh fish with jacket potatoes"", ""Wild boar delicacies"" or ""Guinea fowl with chard""? Dog menus today sound as if you were ordering your favourite meal in a Michelin-starred restaurant. According to the motto: ""Only the best for my dog"", people like to reach for the fine-sounding dog dishes and are delighted with the very special delicacy for their four-legged friend.

Unfortunately, appearances can be deceiving. The current regulations on the labelling of dog food give producers a lot of leeway when it comes to names and ingredients. Some dog menus sound like they contain more than they actually do. The reason for this is the so-called 4% clause as a legal basis, which allows a lot to get away with on cans and bags for our best friends. This clause states that a food called ""fine fish fillets"" only has to contain 4% fish and the rest can consist of other ingredients. In addition to the legally guaranteed 4% in the dog food, the remaining 96% can be made up of whatever is available in dog food production. And there are many possibilities here."
2,Dog food labels: transparency or confusion?,"Turn round once, please: Look at the label","It is always important to look at the back of the label to check whether the contents do what the front promises. You will find all the necessary information about the selected product in the so-called ""declaration"". This includes composition, analysis data, feeding recommendations and additives - to name just a few of the mandatory details provided by the manufacturer. For the composition, the individual components must be listed in descending order of quantity. In addition, the ingredients listed at the top must contain a quantity, so that the remaining composition must be estimated based on the order and quantities disclosed. One obstacle for the consumer is that the manufacturer can choose between an open, semi-open or closed ingredient declaration and is therefore more or less free to decide how much information he actually provides his buyer in the end."
3,Dog food labels: transparency or confusion?,An eye for the essentials: Declaration is everything,"The law offers dog food manufacturers a legal grey area that can also pose challenges for experts. After all, there are various declaration options. In general, there is a distinction between an open, semi-open and closed declaration for animal feed.

An open declaration requires a detailed indication of the amount contained in per cent for each ingredient. For this reason, the ""open declaration"" is almost only used for livestock feed for cattle and pigs.
The ""semi-open declaration"" is more common for dog food. This also contains a detailed description of each ingredient, but not all quantities are stated in order to protect the recipe to a certain extent. The semi-open declaration has the advantage that there is no generalised listing of ingredients in groups or that (precarious) raw materials may be concealed.
Unfortunately, many dog food manufacturers often opt for the ""closed declaration"", which is not quite as consumer-friendly and offers the most leeway on the label. This form is made up of feed groups. Only the overarching group designation such as meat and animal by-products, milk and dairy products or fish and fish by-products is used, regardless of the quality of the raw materials.
Unfortunately, the ""closed declaration"" is not transparent for consumers. Based on such information, no one can recognise exactly which menu components the menu actually contains. If you believe that fine rabbit muscle meat ends up in the bowl, there may theoretically have been many different types of meat and parts used in addition to rabbit. Unfortunately, the label does not reveal this. This is a particular problem for dogs with allergies or intolerances."
4,Dog food labels: transparency or confusion?,"Often read, never thought about: meat and animal by-products","Even for experts, the component labelling of the ""closed declaration"" is not particularly transparent. Such a declaration does not allow consumers in Germany to clearly recognise where the protein in the products (muscle meat, meat and bone meal or soya) comes from. In most cases, the packaging only mentions that ""meat and animal by-products"" or ""vegetable by-products"" have been used.

The term ""animal by-products"" almost always refers to the so-called ""K3 material"". This describes waste that originates from meat slaughtering or processing. It is no longer suitable for human consumption, but can be utilised in dog food, where it serves as a popular source of protein."
5,Dog food labels: transparency or confusion?,Meat is the dog's vegetable,"The consumer recognises a high-quality dog food not only by a clear declaration, but also by the main component of the menu. The ""carni-omnivore"" (carnivorous and omnivorous) dog should always be fed meat as its main food. The quality of the dog food can therefore be assessed on the basis of the meat content alone. Meat should always come first in good food, as the ingredients in the composition appear to decrease in quantity. But be careful, you can also cheat here! Although meat is mentioned first, another part can still predominate if the following individual ingredients outweigh it in total."
6,Dog food labels: transparency or confusion?,Crude protein - it's worth taking a look,"Not only the ratio of the ingredients to each other, but also the analysis data itself contribute to the evaluation of the feed. The crude protein value is particularly important here. If it is too low, the feed does not contain enough meat or contains inferior meat with a possibly high proportion of connective tissue. And watch out! Crude protein can also come from plant components. For example, a feed could contain only 5 % meat and still contain 25 % crude protein. The protein then comes mainly from the added plant sources.

However, the nutritional value and bioavailability of plant proteins for dogs is lower than that of animal proteins, as their metabolism can only break down around 35% of plant proteins. In contrast, dogs absorb up to 90% of animal proteins, which means a significantly higher nutritional value for them and makes the food more valuable. To make an accurate assessment of protein content and food quality, it is therefore necessary to evaluate all labelling information in its entirety. In this way, it is possible that the labelling information reveals more than one would expect at first glance."
7,It? in the food: Diseases of civilisation in dogs,The humanisation of our furry friends - a danger?,"Nowadays there are dogs in down coats, dogs with chequered scarves or glittery harnesses. The dog of the world goes to his own hairdresser, meets up with other dogs in chic places in the city on a specially designated dog meadow or competes in beauty contests with other dogs of the same species. In short: the life of a dog contains (almost) everything that is contrary to its nature. This ""humanisation"" is usually more pronounced in city dogs than in dogs that live in the countryside. Far away from the great outdoors, a dog in the city (of necessity) quickly becomes accustomed to street noise, concrete jungles and fenced-in free-range zones. Thank goodness our dogs are masters of adaptation and can also find their comfort zone in the city.

""The dog needs its dog life. He doesn't want to have fleas, but the opportunity to get them."" (Robert Lembke)

However, the lack of nature and naturalness not only affects dogs' living space and territory, but also their food bowls: meat is replaced by grain, artificial flavourings are used instead of natural flavours and synthetic preservatives are used instead of fresh preparation. The lack of nature leaves its mark on dogs, just as it does on us humans. And these can lead to diseases that are increasingly being diagnosed in dogs as so-called diseases of civilisation."
8,It? in the food: Diseases of civilisation in dogs,Sick due to food allergies,"Ostrich, antelope, kangaroo - ever wilder exotic species are finding their way into our dogs' food bowls. The reason for this is food allergies to animal protein, some types of grain, milk or soya products. This form of reaction to certain food components is steadily increasing in dogs. Promoted by environmental pollution and low-quality feed, one in three skin diseases in dogs is now caused by a food allergy.

In addition to food components, dogs can also have allergic reactions to environmental substances in their environment. A so-called contact allergy can be triggered by blankets, shampoo or collars, for example, and manifests itself through clear skin symptoms.

As there are still no reliable test systems for diagnosing a food allergy in dogs (test reliability of current tests is only around 50%), the only possible diagnosis is to rule out all other diseases. In the case of a food allergy, a so-called exclusion diet must be carried out, which consists of an exotic type of meat and a single vegetable component and must be carried out for at least 8 weeks."
9,It? in the food: Diseases of civilisation in dogs,The spectre of cancer and degenerate cells,"Industrialisation has significantly changed the food spectrum and eating habits of humans. According to studies in cancer research, the proportion of starch has increased massively, making people more susceptible to cancer. Unfortunately, this circumstance has, with a certain delay, also been transferred to our four-legged friends, because in modern times they too are presented with more grain in their bowls than would be healthy for them. The greater supply of carbohydrates or sugar provides degenerated cells with plenty of fuel. This is due to the energy production process, which differs from that of healthy cells, as was demonstrated for the first time in cancer research in 2005.

While protein, fat and only a very small proportion of sugar are converted into energy in the energy centre of a healthy cell, the cancer cell has specialised in the exclusive use of sugar. At the end of this process, lactic acid is produced, which damages surrounding tissue and paves the way for metastases to develop.

Fewer grains or the complete absence of grains means less fuel for the evil cells. In addition to the poor digestibility of cereals in dogs, this is another important argument for feeding these carbohydrates only in small quantities. Whilst bipedal nutritional research is modelled on primitive peoples, a species-appropriate diet for dogs is based on the natural diet of wolves. An important aspect here is naturalness and a low proportion of grain in the diet."
10,It? in the food: Diseases of civilisation in dogs,Quite a chonk: Obesity in dogs,"Overweight in dogs is not uncommon. Many dog owners trivialise their dog's excess weight and refer to it as ""cute flab"" or ""reserves for a rainy day"". However, this is a pathological and unhealthy condition for the dog. In industrialised countries, almost 40% of all dogs are affected by obesity. This means that obesity has been the number one most common disease in German small animal practices for some time now.

If the ""excess weight"" reaches 20 % or more of the normal weight, the specialist speaks of obesity. In this condition, the animal's ribs can no longer be clearly felt and the flank no longer shows the typical indentation. Obesity is caused by an excessive supply of food combined with too little exercise. Furthermore, an inappropriate feed composition with lots of grain, starch and sugar promotes the development of obesity.

Being permanently overweight harbours health risks. It damages the animal's entire musculoskeletal system. Ligaments, tendons and joints are put under excessive strain. This in turn can cause chronic damage such as arthrosis. It also increases the risk of high blood pressure and organ diseases, as well as various metabolic disorders. The excess fat also causes unsightly damage to the skin and coat due to the increased accumulation of fat. Thick calluses and a dull coat without any lustre are classic characteristics of an overweight four-legged friend. In addition to the medical aspects, the animal's quality of life is also reduced."
11,It? in the food: Diseases of civilisation in dogs,Anything but sweet: diabetes in our four-legged friends,"Diabetes in dogs does not differ significantly in its diagnosis and development from the disease of the same name in humans. The beginning, end and cause of this disease is the insulin produced in the pancreas. If this is not made available in sufficient quantities, there is insufficient uptake of sugar into the cells. This lack of insulin is known as primary diabetes (type 1 diabetes) and mainly affects adult dogs. It is caused by overuse, destruction or infection of the insulin-producing ?cells in the pancreas.

Overuse is caused, for example, by a diet that is permanently too fatty and carbohydrate-rich with lots of cereals and starch. Destruction of the insulin-producing cells, on the other hand, is often triggered by so-called autoimmune reactions, in which the dog's immune system is directed against the body's own cells.

The secondary form of diabetes (type 2 diabetes) is the form in which there is less of an insulin deficiency and more of an insulin resistance. This form of diabetes occurs primarily in obese people and in senior dogs, which has earned it the nickname adult-onset diabetes. According to current studies, however, obesity is the undisputed number one cause of diabetes."
12,It? in the food: Diseases of civilisation in dogs,Endless stress - what a dog's life.,"Burnout, sleep disorders, migraines ... Stress seems to be part of everyday life today. Sooner or later, however, the body capitulates and reacts to permanent stress with serious illnesses. Our four-legged friends are no exception. Fear, stress and strain can not only make us ill, but also our four-legged friends.

Stress-related illnesses are serious and verifiable diseases. Under pressure, the so-called stress hormones adrenaline and cortisone are released by the body. They put the body on high alert, which should actually help it to flee quickly in the event of a threat. This increases blood pressure, pulse and respiratory rate, while organs such as the skin, stomach and intestines are supplied with less blood. This state is not a problem in the short term, but can lead to psychological and physical complaints if it persists for a longer period of time.

Just like in humans, the stresses that trigger stress in dogs are varied and individual. Certain odours, noises or a change in daily rhythm can become a classic stress situation for dogs. But competition with other four-legged friends, turbulent holidays or a move to a new home, as well as a sudden change of food, can also lead to stress. An excessively hectic everyday life with constant noise also means pure stress for many four-legged friends. Dogs should therefore always be allowed periods of rest and excursions to quiet natural areas. After all, the best way to combat stress is to simply let your dog be a dog."
